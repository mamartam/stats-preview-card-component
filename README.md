This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies

- HTML5 — semantic markup for structured and accessible content
- CSS3 — styling, layout, and visual design
- CSS Grid — main layout structure
- Flexbox — alignment and spacing of elements
- Responsive Design — mobile-first approach with media queries
- `<picture>` element — adaptive images for different screen sizes
- Google Fonts — Inter and Lexend Deca for typography

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to structure semantic HTML for a clean and accessible layout
- How to use CSS Grid and Flexbox together for responsive design
- Mobile-first approach and writing media queries for different screen sizes
- How to implement adaptive images with the <picture> element
- Overlay effects using CSS filters and positioning with z-index
- Organizing CSS with the BEM naming convention for maintainability
- Typography with Google Fonts and managing font styles effectively

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved?

- Refactor CSS to reduce duplication and simplify media queries
- Enhance accessibility by adding aria labels and better contrast for text
- Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and fonts to make the design more consistent
- Optimize images for faster loading on different devices
- Implement a dark/light mode toggle for better user experience
